# Wild-CowBoy
## Inspiration
We surfed through the internet a lot but could not manage to find much info about Wild West Countries and Cowboys. So we decided to build something on them so that the people who don't know about them get to know about them in a very simple way.

## What it does
Our project has many commands for people like us to know more about cowboys. The list of commands is as follows:
- `/about` - This bot helps people to get to know more about the cowboys
- `/authenticate` - It will authenticate the user using Appwrite 
- `/location` - It cam update/change your location in Appwrite database
- `/shop` - It will let you shop based on the location, fetching it from Appwrite database
- `/songs` - Randomly play cowboy songs fetched from Appwrite 
- `/fact` - Will randomly give cowboy facts from Appwrite database
- `/wwc` - It will tell more about wild west countries 
- `/hat` - It will tell about the cowboy hat
- `/culture` - It will tell more about cowboys culture with a video

## How we built it
- We built it using python and Appwrite where we used Appwrite for all the essential work such as **Authentication**, **Database** and **Hosting**.
- We divided the work in half so that we could manage the whole project to be completed within the time frame.

## Challenges we ran into
- We didn't know where to start from as the theme was very different which was new to both of us.
- We had a lot of team members initially but then many members backed out so it was definitely difficult for the two of us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to complete the whole project in time.
- We were also able to record a good demo video.
- We could learn about wild west countries, cowboys and their culture.
- We were able to complete the project with only 2 team members.

## What we learned
- We learnt to work in a team.
- We learnt to divide the work among ourselves to complete it.
- We learnt to use Appwrite and Telegram bot library.

## What's next for Wild CowBot
- We will add some more commands to out Telegram bot.
- We will also make a website on the theme.
